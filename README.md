# üí´ About me: Particle Physics x ML

Hiii! Nice to meet you! I'm Sara, a particle physicist who applies machine learning (ML) methods to address current challenges in high energy physics. I'm currently holding a research position at CERN, where I work on the next generation of particle colliders to unravel mysteries of our universe! The project is called "Future Circular Collider" (FCC) and tries to characterize the Standard Model of particle physics via probing the Higgs Boson. The Higgs Boson is an elementry particle discovered in 2012 at CERN - but the story is not over, it's a beginning: we want to understand its properties!

## üìå Projects

My github hosts three public repositories: 

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Photon reconstruction with neural networks ([PhotonRecoML](https://github.com/saracreates/PhotonRecoML))

In my [bachelor thesis](https://wwwcompass.cern.ch/compass/publications/theses/2023_bac_aumiller.pdf) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) I have performed a proof-of-principle study to test whether neural networks can help to improve the reconstruction of photons. Photons are "light particles" that can be measured with special detectors (electromagnetic calorimeters). We want to measure where exactly the photon hit the detector and how much energy it had. This is important for any physics program at high-energy experiments. I was part of the COMPASS / AMBER collaboration that runs a fixed-target experiment at CERN. 

### üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Particle signature classification at a future collider at CERN ([FullSimTagger](https://github.com/saracreates/FullSimTagger))

Currently, I'm working on classifying a specific type of particle signature (jet-flavor tagging). As we want to probe the Higgs boson at future colliders, it is important to understand how it is interacting with different particles. Therefore, we want to know in which particles the Higgs boson decays. I study seven possible decay channels of the Higgs boson and distinuigh them with state-of-the-art neural networks. This work is especially important because it contributes to the FCC feasability study due in March 2025. If you want to find out more about this work, read my publication on the [CERN server](https://repository.cern/records/4pcr6-r0d06). 

### üîë Official implemetation of jet-flavor tagging in full simulation at FCC-ee ([JetTagging](https://github.com/saracreates/JetTagging))

Not only my results on jet-flavor tagging are important but also making it available for everyone to use. The future collider community combines its efforts with a common software, [key4hep](https://github.com/key4hep). This repository hosts the official implementation of jet-flavor tagging on full detector simulation of the CLD detector at FCC-ee. It's still work-in-progress.
